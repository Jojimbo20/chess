    Added all pieces 
    Added their move matrices 
    Added the Calculate Postion function
    Added a print_moves() function to show moves

    NEXT:
        Add a matrix of pieces to the Board class
        Add a List of pieces to the player classs

22/11
    Added a pieces[] to <Player> 
    Added an __init__ to <Player>
    Added Player.print_pieces()

    NEXT:
        Add a matrix of pieces to the Board class

    Would be nice:
        Format Player.print_pieces() to have all coordinates line up
        For Piece.calculate_moves() Have it so that the generated possible_moves[] only includes possible moves and not [-1,-1] to represent illegal moves

    Work on adding the Pieces to the board

    Successfully added pieces to the board!
